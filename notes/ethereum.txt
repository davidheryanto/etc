What:
- decentralised value transfer system
- Ethereum: generalised, crypto-law system
- Agreed method of transmitting value: Ether
- History resolution: GHOST protocol

How:
- cryptographically secure, transaction-based state machine
- 

Why:
- Trust vehicle
- Access: geographical, interfacing, incompatiblity, expense, inconvenience

Examples:
	Previous:
	- Hashcash -> Bitcoin: decentralised transaction ledger
	- Litecoin, Primecoin
	- Namecoin: DNS
	- Mastercoin

Dev:
- World state: nonce, balance, storageRoot, codeHash
- Transaction -> message calls OR contract creation
	- nonce: no of transactions sent by the sender
	- gasPrice: computation cost (in Wei = 10^-18 Eth)
	- gasLimit: max gas for transaction
	- to: 160-bit address of recipient
	- value: in Wei
- Contract implementations
	- Data feeds
