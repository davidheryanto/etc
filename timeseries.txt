Exploration:
1. Any seasonal trends? No: Can use regular ARIMA
2. If looking at daily too much variation, resample it to monthly or look at rolling mean

Stationary data:
1. Mean of the series independent of time
2. Variance independent of time
3. covariance of the i-th term and the (i + m)-th term independent of time
Test with Dickey Fuller Test (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickey%E2%80%93Fuller_test)

Transformation to make series stationary (http://people.duke.edu/~rnau/whatuse.htm):
- Deflation by CPI
- Deflation at fixed rate
- Logarithm
- First diff
- Seasonal diff
- Seasonal adjustment

Techniques:
1. Seasonal Trend Decomposition using Loess: trend, seasonality, remainder
2. Autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) in ARIMA model (Tuning advice: http://people.duke.edu/~rnau/arimrule.htm)
